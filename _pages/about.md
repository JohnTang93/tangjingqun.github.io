I am a research scientist specializing in multimodal learning fields at ByteDance Inc.

I have been engaged in document intelligence research for over seven years. Previously, I worked at Tencent Youtu Lab and NetEase Hangzhou Research Institute.

 I have published more than 20 papers in top-tier AI conferences such as CVPR, NeurIPS, ACL, and ECCV, with 10 of them as first author or corresponding author, accumulating over 1,100 citations. And I serve as an Area Chair for ACMMM2025, ICDAR2025.  Additionally, I have won championships in international competitions like CVPR, ICCV, and ICDAR competitions on seven occasions.
